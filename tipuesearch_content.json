My main quest revolves around ecological and environmental issues, and this website is a place where I share thoughts, analysis and rants about them, but also document how I try to deal with them as a permaculture designer, gardener, herbalist, IT guy and human being.

Playing around is a great source of inspiration.","tags":"pages","title":"index","url":"pages/index.html"},{"text":"Self-awarded, mostly","tags":"pages","title":"Trophies","url":"pages/trophies.html"}]}
