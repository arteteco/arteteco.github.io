You may find it boring, but whatever, is not all about shiny and funny bells in life! For the shiny and colorful bells you can read the introduction article . The plot is around 100 sqm, a very small garden, with some fruit trees already in place. Location, climate Location is in south Italy, altitude around 300m Temperatures in winter rarely get below -3°C and in summer rarely over 38°C Precipitations are around 1 meter per year, can be abundant during winter and dry for months during summer. This is something I try not to rely to, probably due to climate changing we had 9 months of drought last year, with very heavy precipitation this year. Soil and plants there already Soil was compacted, quite leaked of nutrients as rain was getting soil out of the area. pH was around neutral if somewhat basic. Trees already there included an apricot tree (15 yrs ~), a pomegranade, 2 lemon trees which bear no fruit due to shady conditions and were therefore replanted, a female kiwi which yields no fruit 'cause no male was there and a strawberry tree. They were all in good health but left unpruned for many years. Main herbaceous layer was grass blades (so called \"weeds\"). They did a wonderful job of keeping some roots in the soil and some flowers for the bees while no one was caring for it. Life in the soil was poor, in a massive digging we only found 2-3 worms. A circular paper chromatography revealed a decent mineral content but little life. Sector analysis The biggest problem here was water : even just a light rain would have spilled over the garden, leaking nutrients and soil, as in the image. The garden is facing south but doesn't really matter as most of the area was in the shade anyway, due to high buildings. You can see the shadier parts in the map. Buildings are also shielding the place from most of the wind . History The area has been neglected and abandoned for many years, only thing done has been removing all fallen leaves in autumn, actively preventing the soil from building up, so it was compacted and quite poor in terms of biodiversity. Fruit trees were planted almost randomly during the history of the house by my grandfather, who is no more. Goals So, before doing anything it's important to know what I was going to do with the garden, what did everyone wanted from it? After some talk this is what came out of it: My little brother is also living there, and I wanted a place for him to stop using the xbox and have some fun with worms. I wanted to experiment with some guilds and plants and kill time. Everybody wanted some fresh, good quality food (it was not the main goal though, experiments were a higher priority). It needed to be low maintenance and possibly good looking (beauty keeps places alive, no one is doing much efforts to mantain something ugly). The actual design Green: perennial area Yellow: annuals Brown: compost/mix White: pathway The pathway was done just with recycled pallets Walking path Here no plants are kept and it has been dug and some wood debris has been placed underneath, to allow water to i nfiltrate and create soil instead of spilling over. It has been done big enough to allow comfortable walking (hey, my grandma is 75 years old!) and for a ladder to be used, so minimum 60 cm wide. The proper social area is a bit larger. Perennial area Wouldn't call it a food forest as it is too small to actually have a forest dynamics, but that was the inspiration. Here is where most of the perennials already were, and it hasn't been worked much. The soil was digged, mixed with some aged horse manure and then heavily mulched. Guilds were set in place from the beginning. Corn, beans and pumpkins, the famous three sisters Annual - transitional part This was the most compacted and bare area. In a corner a fire used to be made at St Antony's day, as good wish. So we choose: that is the corn-er area (ahah,got it?). It was heavily dug and big trunks of wood and horse manure were buried underneath to provide a slow nutrient release, a sponge-like structure for water and an inoculation of soil microbial life (some wood was taken from a nearby forest). It is like a hugelkultur but, as we don't live in a high-precipitation area, it was not raised. Here annuals for an immediate yield were planted, first year has seen many peas, beans, corn (ancient variety from north Italy), pumpkins, ancient tomatoes, and then cauliflower broccoli and so on. Mainly annual plants, and it gave some decent harvest, but now it's slowly turning into a more perennial system . I planted an almond tree, some fennel and a male kiwi to impollinate the female. The idea is to slowly turn it into a highly productive multi-storied perennial system. Compost area I have done a small compost area at the very entrance, which is not how you usually do it. Actually, it was more hidden before, but my grandmother and people living in the house were just leaving everything at the entrance. I just made it more \"official\". Go with the flow . I usually just toss the organic stuff as mulch when I'm here, anyway. Species selection The main idea was to create few guilds around the main trees: almond, hazelnut, apricot, kiwi, strawberry tree, pomegrenade and a more herbacious area. Each new perennial has been inoculated with mychorrizal fungi when planted. The guild followed simple lines, and I put an emphasys on stuff for pollinators and local insects, so borage, marigold, cornflower and nasturtium seeds have been generously thrown here and there. Also, most of the plant had to be edible, only notable exception has been russian comfrey (Symphitum officianalis var. bocking 14), which provides biomass, helps to break the soil and it's gorgeous. I'll get maybe more into each specific guild in other articles. Structures In order to accomodate all plants planted I needed a greenhouse. Couple of pallets and some plastic roll, everything found in the trash, done. Some worm casting could have been useful for the new plants, so I set up a worm composting barrel, and those guys really are my little brother favorites. Phases of implementation The basic idea is that year 0 will have more annuals, the basic structures built and so on, year 1 will start to see some results and a gradual shift to an almost entirely perennial ecosystem, and the whole garden will reach maximum yielding at year 4, hopefully keeping it for a while. Consider that this area is too small to have a highly yielding self-sustaining system, and a continuous input from the outside, in form of kitchen scraps, paper and water is needed. Year 0 Many annuals planted, some to get some yield (corn, grains, pumpkins etc), others to start dispersing seeds around (borage, local tomatoes varieties, marigold). Some perennials were brought in, some planted, some bought. Soil was always covered, worked with generous aged manure, a porous tube irrigation system was set in place. Year 1 Yields will be less than year 0: less annuals, trees will be pruned, many small plants will start to really yield in year 2. Also, some space will still be used for soil-working plants, like radishes. Less work than year 0, just planting, mulching and harvesting basically. Under the pathway Year 2 I plan to remove the irrigation system and use it for other gardens, as the biomass should now be enough to avoid watering at all. The production will start to rise, and the maintenance getting low. There should be little need to introduce new plants now, as the useful guys will be dispersed all around, and harvesting, adding biomass and some pruning will take most of the work. Year 4 Should be at the peak. No work anymore beside harvesting and pruning (but we'll work at it anyway to try new plants, of course!), and the life should be thriving so hard that the walls will crumble down and let this wave of fertility invade the whole neighbourhood.

And man it was fun. The whole idea at the beginning was to experiment with guilds and produce some tomatoes, then it evolved into something more. It is now a food producing, living lab, fresh-microclimate provider, with an embedded audio by courtesy of the many birds and insects passing by. Working in the garden should be a pleasure If you stare at a point in the garden long enough, you start to see lizards, bugs, spiders, all of it while eating strawberries from the plant. How cool is that , if you just forget about the mosquitoes which I didn't manage to get rid of just yet. But it wasn't always like this. I mean, mosquito-wise yes, but before the place was poor with life, quite simple (read: fragile and boring), and less colorful. Don't want to bore you with the details, but I'll put some design notes in this article . Now I just want to share some happiness for reaching version 0.1 of this garden, called 20 steps because well, that's all it takes you to get from one end of it to another. The road to it.. .. was quite smooth, with the occasional bump. Working the soil is not that fun by hand. One of the reasons I like regenerative ecosystems is that you usually invest a lot of work upfront but then kick back and do a light maintenance. Why do more than that. There was a lot of digging, a lot of resources patiently collected in a month or so (I was working as a personal driver at the time, so had many chances of peeking in many trashes!), and some social tension when I told my grandmother to put the kitchen scraps in the garden. A shit , I tell you, that was the best part. A ton of horseshit, I love playing with that stuff. Anyway, the game was finding those otherwise boring works enjoyable, so we called for a few friends here to work and then eat all together, made it a game with my 9 yo brother, and I entered a friendly competition with my neighbor who also started his veggie garden at about the same time. He produced more that year, if we ignore the fruit tree production, but his soil now sucks, while mine is a brown gold. If you ask him, of course, he produced more and my garden is a mess, so I'd say each one won its own way. Snow is a decent mulch too .. and then the results I was quite satisfied with the results. The soil is way better now , there is an automated irrigation system, and even though production is not at the peak yet (should get there next year), I already harvested pumpkins, corn, many cabbages, nettle, tomatoes, onions, chilly, and herbs like parsley, sage, basil, rosemary and more. Not bad, for a place that also gave me some great insights. Other yields are a ton of cuttings, seeds and plants that I used to guerrilla garden in the area, so I can boost production using abandoned public places for next years. Some nice experiments include a capillarity string watering (yeah, didn't work well), worm towers in the ground (worked pretty well), and trying to adapt some species to more shady conditions. Beside, it has many flowers like borage, watercress (it doesn't need that much water, what do you know), marigold and calendula, all edible, and many insects which I don't know if are edible, haven't tried yet frankly. One of the best results is that some friend got excited by it and I've helped doing their place too, hoping to push further this geometric expansion of regenerative self production of food- No mistakes? Yeah well, I've done some disturbingly silly things in here. A proper organic mulch looks so great! From the pictures you may see how shady everything is : and I've pruned already this year! I decided to plant an hazelnut in the deep shade, shading everything even more. Yes I did. I had big plans of getting it to go towards the roof and all, but I'm now waiting for the autumn to remove it and use it to guerrilla garden. I often lose what I plant . I don't know how that happens. I lost the cucumber plants at one point last year, only to find a ripe cucumber a few months later. The other cucumbers just disappeared. I underplanted the groundcover layer . I focused a lot on mulching to build the soil in the first year, but now there are too many spots without plants, and that is not helping. That is also because I plant small saplings, than I forget about them and just cover them in my psychotic relationship with mulch. All in all, it could have been worst =) Cool, isn't it? This was a rather small area. If you have some place, consider that working it doesn't need to be a stress, but a pleasure and a trip of wonder in the field of natural sciences, and a puzzle game in how to fit all you can together and optimize the whole system for your yields. Some Before-After Before After Before After Before After","tags":"Gardens","url":"20steps/"},{"title":"Dynamic accumulators","text":"I believed in dynamic accumulators for a while, religiously repeating what I read in many books. But after a client sincerely asked me to provide him some sources for how they are supposed to work, I found myself with a silent pubmed , an internet stacked of gardening/permaculture websites that just referred to each other as source, and the uncomfortable but refreshing feeling of haven't done my homework properly before opening my mouth. Best article I found was this one , by John Kitsteiner (I highly recommend him and his website, temperate climate permaculture ). Seems like he followed a similar path: searched, nothing found. He sent a few emails to \"big names\" such as Toby Hemenway and Dave Jacke, and they both admitted that they didn't have any research to substantiate the very concept of dynamic accumulator. The wikipedia page was not exempt from this dynamic accumulators hype, so I had to rewrite the page, basically down up. So I'm now celebrating another nice page. Yahoo! Borage and Comfrey are beautiful and useful plants, even without any myth around them.","tags":"misc","url":"dynamicaccumulators/"},{"title":"Introduction to Regen Network","text":"One of the main causes of the environmental degradation right now is that not caring about its effect on the environment is a winning model for a company, especially in the agricultural field. There is a continous positive feedback, easy bureaucracy, less costs, subsidies from the state and more. Someone who wants to go for a regenerative approach, on the other hand, has to face many negative feedbacks: has to work extra hard for less money, doesn't usually get subsidies, quite the opposite and actually has to go against the law, and needs a lot of knowledge, just to start. I'm quite sure that pushing the feedbacks in the right direction is of paramount importance if we want to get the ecosystem on its feet. What does Regen Network do Money is usually backed by something. Often by gold, sometimes money was gold, other times by petrol, or GDP. In general, though, you don't see money backed and connected to the real source of value: natural resources, water, fertility, air, life. The abstraction layers are so and such that it may be difficult to see that that is the start of all other values. Regen Network (RN) is trying to give that environmental value an economic counterpart, and to incentivize positive economical feedbacks to rigenerative companies by using a decentralized model. It was created by some well known names in the permaculture world, like Christian Shearer and Gregory Landua. Right now is still gathering funds, so it hasn't started yet. So, ignoring the technical details, this is what RN is aiming to do: be a verified database of the data collected in the places that joined the network. It will allow to verify in a transparent manner that the soil and the environemnt there is really getting better (or worst). The data is obtained using various protocols, involving on-site sensors, satellite data, third party verifications and more. Put in contact entities with interest in financiate rigenerative projects (institutions, privates, no-profit...) and the projects themselves, using a smart contract model. Develop the general health of the RN by working on protocols, helping the community and kick-starting regenerative projects. How does it do it ''Blockchain''. Regen network will have as a decentralized database a blockchain (based on tindermint engine), which will be processed and validated by many independent nodes, garanteeing the metadata of the informations (time, place and so on), and that the informations are true, because all the nodes will have a copy of those informations (or of the hashing of the off-chain informations, but I don't want to get into technicalities) ''Environmental State Protocols (ESP)'', practically algorithms that allow to get useful informations from the data and to quantify the effects on the environment. For example, a protocol may consider the quantity of green as seen from a satellite and the values of on-site sensors for albedo and pressure to indicate that there actually is a cover crop on that field, and how much. The implications of being able to really see what's going on on a land and to authomatically elaborate the data, without getting corruptible third parties in the middle, is one of the main strength of the project ''Smart Contracts'', called ''Ecological Conctracts'' in RN. Those are automated contracts that, starting from the informations gathered with protocols, allow to unlock the funds from a donor to who reaches the goals. It may sound complex, but let's see some simple example Examples Italy realizes that reaching the goal of the Paris Agreement is harder than it thought. So, it puts money away to financiate everyone who can prove to sequester carbon from the atmosphere by using a set of protocols, putting subsidies for, like, 200 € per hectar if the soil gets over a certain degree of carbon sequestered. The process is immediate as it uses a smart contract, in the moment that the improvement is registered by the blockchain the payment starts in an authomatic way and the funds are released (euros, bitcoins, XRN or whatever) Mario doesn't wont to pay those shady guys from the Bio certifications, but doesn't know how to garanteee to his customers that he is really producing food stuff while making the environment better. Using a series of protocols he shows everyone the data from his place, and the consumers can see by themselves how his work is impacting the soil. This is better than a certification, and gives him quite some advertisment. Raphael has a big land and gathers a lot of data, beside everything else, he decides to keep his data available only on purchase, as the data is his and he can do whatever he wants with it. Many big data and research companies need good quality data, and Mario gets an extra income by providing data A comnsumer can easily look around him for farmers that work in a way that is improving the environment, and go for them as his choice Now, let's get this straight, I don't think that carbon in the atmosphere is \"the\" problem. Sequester carbon into the soil should be a welcomed side effect of activities that aim for an ecological restoration, not a scope in itself. I am not a meteorologist, but from what I've studied carbon is not anyway the only thing that matter in the planet temperature rising, the high altitude humidity for example may be accountable for a more pronunciated effect. But you know, carbon is on everyone's mounth lately, and is anyway a good indicator of the work done, we should probably keep it as that. Conclusions I still have quite some doubts about this project. The idea is nice, and I am sure it may have many use cases that I have not foreseen, but I'll wait for the webinair in two days to get a more solid idea.

La borraggine e la consolida sono bellissime e utilissime, anche senza favole attorno.","tags":"misc","url":"it/dynamicaccumulators/"},{"title":"Introduzione al Regen Network","text":"Una delle principali cause del degrado ambientale attuale è che per un'impresa non curarsi dei propri effetti sulla biosfera è un modello vincente, soprattutto nell'agricoltura. C'è un feedback positivo continuo, con vendite maggiori, cose più facili, con sussidi statali talvolta poco sensati, con spese inferiori, mentre un approccio rigenerativo all'agricoltura, per quanto possa essere utile nel grande ordine delle cose, incontra spesso molti feedback negativi: molto lavoro, entrate più basse, difficoltà burocratiche, e bisogno di un'enorme iniezione di conoscenze per iniziare. Sono convinto, ma ne parlerò più dettagliamente in futuro, che spingere i feedback nella giusta direzione sia fondamentale per risolvere qualcosa. Cosa fa Regen Network Il denaro è solitamente collegato a qualcosa. Spesso è stato considerato un equivalente dell'oro, a volte era l'oro stesso, altre volte è collegato al petrolio o al PIL. In generale, però, non si vede mai il denaro collegato alla vera fonte di valore: le risorse naturali, acqua, fertilità, aria, vita. I livelli di astrazione sono tanti e tali da rendere difficile vedere che è quella la fonte iniziale di ogni altro valore. Regen Network è un tentativo di dare a quel valore ambientale una controparte economica e promuovere feedback economici alle attività rigeneratrici utilizzando un modello decentralizzato. È creato da alcuni nomi piuttosto noti negli ambienti permaculturali e di agricoltura rigenerativa, come Christian Shearer e Gregory Landua. Attualmente è ancora in una fase di raccolta fondi, e il progetto non è ancora partito. Alla fine della fiera, se vogliamo ignorare tutti i dettagli tecnici, fa fondamentalmente tre cose: Fa da verificatore e database decentralizzato delle informazioni ottenute nei luoghi che aderiscono al progetto. In pratica permette di verificare in maniera trasparente che in un luogo il suolo stia davvero migliorando, o che davvero stia aumentando l'infiltrazione di acqua nel suolo. I dati vengono ottenuti tramite vari protocolli che includono sensori, dati satellitari, report di terze parti o in prima persona. Fa da tramite tra enti che vogliono finanziare i progetti rigenerativi (istituzioni, privati, no-profit, quel che sia) e i progetti stessi, utilizzando un modello di smart contract. Sviluppa in generale la salute del progetto incentivando la produzione di protocolli, le comunità, i singoli progetti agricoli e l'adozione. Come lo fa Blockchain .Regen network avrà come database decentralizzato una blockchain, validata e processata da più nodi indipendenti, garantendo i metadati delle informazioni (orario, luogo ecc.) e che le informazion in sé siano veritiere, perché tutti i nodi avranno una copia delle informazioni (o degli hashing delle informazioni conservati off-chain, ma non voglio entrare in tecnicismi) Environmental State Protocols (ESP) : in pratica dei semplici algoritmi che permettono, dai dati ottenuti, di ricavare delle informazioni utili e quantificare le effettive migliorie nell'ambiente. Ad esempio, un protocollo potrebbe considerare la quantità di verde vista da satellite e i valori di sensori per pressione umidità ed albedo per indicare che in un luogo ci sia effettivamente un cover crop o meno, e quanto. Il valore di poter sapere cosa accade davvero in un terreno e poter elaborare automaticamente i dati, senza mettere in mezzo terze parti e complessi controlli suscettibili di corruzione, è il punto di forza maggiore del progetto. Smart Contracts , chiamati in RN Ecological Contracts. Questi sono i contratti automatizzati che, partendo dalle informazioni date dai protocolli, permettono di sbloccare l'accesso a dei fondi da parte di chi raggiunge gli obiettivi. Può sembrare complesso, ma vediamo qualche esempio terra terra. Esempi L'Italia si rende conto che raggiungere gli obiettivi del concordato di Parigi è più arduo di quanto previsto. Stanzia quindi dei finanziamenti per chiunque dia prova di sequestrare carbonio tramite un set di protocolli, mettendo sovvenzioni chessò, a 200 euro ad ettaro per chi raggiunga una certa soglia di miglioramento. Il processo è istantaneo attraverso uno smart contract, nel momento in cui viene verificato il miglioramento in maniera automatica vengono sbloccati i fondi sotto forma di euro, bitcoin, regen network token, o altro Mario non vuole pagare la mafia del marchio Bio, ma non sa come garantire ai suoi consumatori che davvero produce robba buona e migliora l'ambiente. Utilizzando una serie di protocolli mette a disposizione di tutti i rilevamenti del suo terreno, e i consumatori possono vedere da soli che le cose migliorano, vedere le immagini satellitari e valutare il lavoro di Mario, che si fa pure un po' di pubblicità. Raffaele ha un terreno e raccoglie molti dati. Decide di rendere disponibili i dati sotto pagamento, o abbonamento. Sono i suoi e ci fa quello che vuole, e molte compagnie di ricerca pagano per avere dati di buona qualità. Un'ulteriore fonte di entrata per Raffaele. Un consumatore può facilmente cercare vicino a lui imprese che lavorano in maniera positiva per l'ambiente, e scegliere quelle anche perché il cibo è facilmente più buono Ora, intendiamoci, io non credo che il carbonio nell'atmosfera sia il problema. Sequestrare carbonio nel suolo dovrebbe essere un gradito effetto collaterale di attività che puntano a ripristinare falde acquifere, purificare il terreno, rivitalizzarlo, ridare habitat a specie a rischio, chiudere i cicli di acqua e materiale organico in loco, non un obiettivo in sé. Non sono un meteorologo, ma gli studi letti mi hanno portato a pensare che il metano e l'umidità ad alta quota siano ad esempio più gravi del carbonio nell'atmosfera per l'effetto serra. Il carbonio però è una parola che fa tanto parlare di sé ultimamente, ed è comunque un indicatore utile per i lavori svolti, teniamocelo buono. So per certo che questa è anche l'opinione del Regen Network. Conclusioni Ho ancora qualche dubbio su questo progetto. L'idea è buona, e sono sicuro che tante altre applicazioni possono derivare a cui ancora non ho pensato, ma attenderò il webinar che ci sarà tra due giorni per trarne un'idea più solida.

D'altronde, ricordo che anche in gioventù cercare di fare acchiappanza con le tecniche dei grandi guru si è rivelata una tecnica sempre più imbarazzante che altro.
